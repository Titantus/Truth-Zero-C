## Overview

**T’Z0C** is a modular, object-oriented Python simulation framework. It serves as a unified rendering architecture for coherent universes, modeling the physics of the C-Ladder—a hierarchical canvas structure that translates microscopic angular momentum (spin) into macroscopic volume expansion (gravity). 



## The Core Axiom: Asymmetrical Neutralization
The framework is anchored by the **Neutralization Equivalency**, which posits that the four fundamental forces are not distinct entities, but differential damping expressions of a single zero-point tension ($3 - 3 = 5 - 5 = 0$):

$$\Delta \Phi_{canvas} = \left[ \sum_{i} \pm \frac{1}{2}\hbar \omega_i \right]_{Wound} \equiv \left[ \sum_{j} \pm \hbar \vec{k}_j c \right]_{Unwound} \equiv 0$$

* **Wound State:** Localized mass/spin (The "3").
* **Unwound State:** Linear radiation/light (The "5").
* **Dimensional Friction:** Forces are the canvas-specific signatures of these states neutralizing across different frequency limits ($c^4 \rightarrow c^0$).

## Technical Competencies Demonstrated

* **Unified Systems Architecture:** Migration from fragmented scripts to a consolidated, class-based Python engine (`UniversalBIOS`, `Full_Canvas_Cascade_Engine`).
* **Scientific Simulation:** Implementation of Yukawa-damped potential solvers to model force-range hierarchies from nuclear ($10^{-15}$ m) to macroscopic ($10^0$ m) scales.
* **Publication-Grade Visualization:** Automated rendering of academic-standard figures using Matplotlib with LaTeX-style unit enforcement.
* **Interactive UI/UX:** Development of a Jupyter-embedded dashboard for real-time hypothesis testing and figure export.

## Simulation Modules (v5.2)

The **T'Z0C Peer-Review Engine** executes four primary modules:

| Module | Description | Engine |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Group A** | Geometric Core: Siphon efficiency and the 109.47° invariance lock. | `SiphonDynamicsEngine` |
| **Group B** | Stability & Noise: Hypersensitivity cliff-edge analysis. | `SolidStateRigidity` |
| **Group C** | Torque & Decoherence: Phonon envelope collapse via pulse sequence. | `ResonanceControlSuite` |
| **Group D** | Macro Scaling: 5-Tier Möbius Cascade for dimensional reduction. | `Full_Canvas_Cascade_Engine` |

## Run Instructions

1. **Access:** [Clone the Repository](https://github.com/Titantus/Truth-Zero-C) or open `TZ0C_Lab_v5.ipynb` directly in Google Colab.
2. **Environment:** Ensure standard scientific stack (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `ipywidgets`) is installed.
3. **Execution:** Run the **"Monolith"** cell to initialize the BIOS and interactive dashboard.
4. **Export:** Use **Group E** in the UI dropdown to generate the formal cross-reference table for manuscript inclusion.
