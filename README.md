Truth Zero C (T’Z0C) — Unified Rendering Framework for Coherent Universes v4a

**A Unified Rendering Framework for Canvases, Collapse, and Coherent Universes**

**Author:** Jon M. Craig  
**Version:** v4a (Peer-Review Edition)  
**Date:** February 26, 2026  

---

## Overview

**T’Z0C** is a self-contained mathematical and engineering architecture that describes how *any* coherent universe capable of completing truth-cycles must operate. It is not a traditional physics theory but a rendering-system specification — the "BIOS + OS + hardware" of reality itself.

This repository contains everything needed to understand, reproduce, and verify the framework in one lightweight package.

### Key Features
- Complete 118-element registry with computed T’Z0C metrics (torque density, siphon efficiency, invariant angles, etc.)
- Invariant Convergence Principle (Million-Run Bond-Angle Law)
- Full C-Ladder physics, V³ Trifecta, Acoustic Siphon engineering, and sub-surface lattice mechanics
- Reproducible hypothesis validation suite (4 one-click tests)
- Complete Card Catalog with direct links to all 000–900 series Google Drive folders
- Interactive Colab-ready dashboard (`TZ0C_Lab_v4a_Peer_Review.ipynb`)

## Quick Start (Recommended)

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**:
   - [TZ0C_Lab_v4a_Peer_Review.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/) (upload the `.ipynb` file)

2. Upload the `TZ0C_v4a_Peer_Review_Package.json` file when prompted (or run the first cell — it will guide you).

3. Run all cells (Runtime → Run all).

4. Go to the **"2. Molecular Analysis"** tab and click any of the four **Hypothesis Validation** buttons for instant, reproducible results.

## Reproducible Hypothesis Tests

All four core hypotheses can be verified instantly in the notebook:

1. **Intrinsic Element Scaling Law** — Mass vs. Shake Frequency correlation
2. **Molecular Geometric Convergence Principle** — Strain energy vs. manifested angle
3. **Universal Resonance & 0.14° Bounce Gap** — Visual proof of the torque reservoir
4. **Cross-Disciplinary Demo** — QM / Classical / TOE implications

Each test produces a plot + statistical result + plain-English interpretation.
