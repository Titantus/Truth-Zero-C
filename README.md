## Overview

**T’Z0C** is a modular, object-oriented Python simulation framework. It was engineered to mathematically model and visualize a unified rendering architecture for coherent universes—specifically bridging the gap between quantum-scale angular momentum (spin) and macroscopic volume expansion (gravity) using non-thermal energy transfer mechanics.

While rooted in theoretical physics, this repository serves as a demonstration of **advanced systems architecture, discrete state-machine modeling, and scientific computing**.

### Core Engineering Competencies Demonstrated
* **Object-Oriented Architecture:** 60+ fragmented logic scripts consolidated into a unified, class-based Python engine (`UniversalBIOS`, `SiphonDynamicsEngine`, `Full_Canvas_Cascade_Engine`).
* **Scientific Computing:** Implementation of non-linear differential equation solvers (`scipy.integrate.odeint`) to model time-domain energy collapse and phonon damping.
* **Discrete State Machines:** Multi-tiered thermodynamic loop modeling (The 5-Canvas Cascade) integrating discrete thresholds with continuous torque accumulation.
* **Data Visualization:** Interactive, publication-grade UI dashboard built with `ipywidgets` and `matplotlib` for dynamic hypothesis testing.

## The Core Mathematical Axiom

The engine operates on the **T'Z0C Neutralization Equivalency**, modeling the universe as an active canvas neutralizing an asymmetrical definition of zero:

$$\Delta \Phi_{canvas} = \left[ \sum_{i} \pm \frac{1}{2}\hbar \omega_i \right]_{Wound} \equiv \left[ \sum_{j} \pm \hbar \vec{k}_j c \right]_{Unwound} \equiv 0$$

*The engine calculates the dimensional friction required to hold localized mass ($\hbar$ spin) apart from radiated energy ($\hbar k$ wave) across four distinct geometric canvas limits ($c^4 \rightarrow c^0$).*

## Simulation Modules (v5.2)

The `TZ0C_Lab_v5.ipynb` interactive runner executes four primary simulation groups:

1. **Group A: Geometric Core (Siphon Atlas)** *Engine:* `SiphonDynamicsEngine`  
   *Function:* Plots rendering fidelity as a function of bond angle, defining the structural bounce gap and the 109.47° tetrahedral invariance lock.
2. **Group B: Stability & Noise (Cliff-Edge)** *Engine:* `SolidStateRigidity`  
   *Function:* Contour mapping of hypersensitivity to angular detuning vs. thermal noise, proving the necessity of non-thermal coherence regimes.
3. **Group C: Torque & Decoherence (Phonon Kill)** *Engine:* `ResonanceControlSuite`  
   *Function:* ODE simulation of step-function phonon envelope collapse triggered by precise angular resonance pulses.
4. **Group D: Macro Scaling (5-Tier Cascade)** *Engine:* `Full_Canvas_Cascade_Engine`  
   *Function:* Simulates dimensional reduction and macroscopic volume expansion triggered sequentially by threshold saturation (The Möbius Flip).
